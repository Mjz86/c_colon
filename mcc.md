
c colon lang , its brothers and the mcc ABI 



> introduction







in this document, we specify the application binary interface ( ABI ) for c colon programs: that is, the object code interfaces between different user-provided c colon program fragments and between those fragments and the implementation-provided runtime and libraries. this includes the memory layout for c colon data objects, including both predefined and user-defined data types, as well as internal compiler generated objects such as virtual tables. it also includes function calling interfaces, exception handling interfaces, global naming, and various object code conventions.



in general, this document is meant to serve as a generic specification which can be used by c colon implementations on a variety of platforms. this is inspired by the famous Itanium ABI , there are sometimes assumptions of 64-bit targets, it is usually straightforward to recognize these non portable assumptions and translate them appropriately, e.g. by replacing a 64-bit pointer with a 32-bit pointer.



this document is not an authoritative definition of the c colon ABI for any particular platform. platform vendors retain the ultimate power to define the c colon ABI for their platform. platforms using this ABI for c colon should declare that they do so, either unmodified or with a certain set of changes.



also, this is generally incomplete, the c colon spec and mcc ABI of that spec will be more refined in each revisions.



the formatting of this document is currently not very well, under scores are not meant for italic.

what's c colon



![Logo](https://github.com/Mjz86/c_colon/blob/main/icon/c_colon.png)





a language inspired by c++ and rust, and some functional principles.



this language aims to be in the "c++ successor" language  categories, 

having c++ like syntax but with memory safety ,

aiming to be able to express c++'s full power while  freeing the language from the ABI stability nightmare  that the wg21 standard committee made and the stack consuming windows calling convention ABI.





this languages goals include:





1. the option of performance at the cost of verbosity:

the mcc toolchain needs as much information as it can about the program,

this information helps immensely in optimizations and it also makes the intention of the developers clear.

the language has lifetime annotations,  borrow rules , qualifier rules , pointers and many sorts of reference, operator overloading , a powerful context-type for explicit  control over many implicit operations,  all trying to make it safe and efficient to execute.



2. striving for zero cost abstractions:

each operation that can be optimized at compile time will be optimized at compile time,

the link times in mcc may increase from the calling conventions burden, but it's for the runtime.





3. safety as the default, with unsafe(...) as escape hatch:

similar to rust, c: has a borrow checker, a powerful one, the local safety and borrow rules prevent global uninitialized access, use after free and more.

similar to rust, c: has unsafe blocks, these unsafe blocks are specified with their safety control, for example unsafe(pointer-use) or unsafe(pointer-cast), unsafe(unrestricted), unsafe(variable) and more unsafe specifiers.

the rust language, although very fast, still lacks the option of non trivial moves, the option of elegant linked lists, the option of self referential small string/buffer optimization. it can be achieved with pointers, but it will not look good.

although like rust these are unsafe in c:, these are not totally disallowed, they are just unrestricted in c colon. unrestricted keyword aims to be of use for those who want fast iteration speed like in game dev,

although, at the cost of safety (using unsafe(unrestricted) ) and maybe performance (for example because its not safe to assume in the compiler that two spans are non overlapping so less SIMD usage).

note that some qualifier are unsafe to add or remove, for example the no alias qualifiers may lead to UB if removed so it has to be unsafe.

unlike  c++'s default of code not being able to run at compile time,  code using mutability and unstable, 

c: would use and be written with functional looking defaults,

for example a variable with no qualifier would be implicitly stable , const , safe and etc..

or an `inout` would be implicitly mutable , and so on,

these would make most code value oriented and functional,  

and a code similar to CPP with rust like safety would be achieved. 









4. compile time code:

the c colon spec aims to use way more compile time code.





5. multi paradigm language:

its like c++ but the legacy has been striped away.





6. ABI stability with ever changing libraries:

the recursive hash ABI aims to tag each component with all the dependencies with a hash, without the need for inline namespaces, and it even propagates.

this property of propagation through every type, function and namespace, makes us able to link everything old with everything new without ODR violations, and new components can just use a middle API to interface to new code.

imagine a world were the old std::regex was used for old code and the same std regex was 10 times faster when used new code both coexisting.

this truly makes it paying for what we used. the old programmer paid for old slow usage, but new code did not have to pay for the burdens in old code.

and each independent code that stayed unchanged did not need duplications, a dream for the CPP committee, and a possibility in mcc, the c colon ABI .

the hashes although not cryptographically secure are big enough to be unique, basically like a UUID (because its just a name mangling scheme).

if there's a cycle in the hash dependency chain, the problem is ill formed and notified of the need to use the  `abi=`  operator that doesn't rely on something  else at least one node in that cycle,

although  a rare occurrence might be that  the f() , `abi=(f())`  when calling the `constexpr` f , itself needs f, so , while such issues cannot be avoided due to the halting problem,  its still relatively easy to fix when noticing the `constexpr` max evaluation steps has been reached. 

also , using `abi=` on a member doesn't change the members real type and hash , and even if in some cases it  does, its still possible  to `unsafe(abi-cast)` the hash to the original type's hash ( variable definition having the type be type1 `abi=(abiof(type2))` or at most an unsafe `reinterpret_cast` known as pointer-cast or a bit cast)





 * as a gist :

It's similar to Itanium,  however, 

The name has an appended `xxhash128` , of its signature, 

Every type function and namespace has these hashes , and they recursively depend on each other ( for a cycle,  like in a graphs node type , there are operators such as `abi=,abi+,abiof` that operate on the 128 hashes)

This makes the language entirely ABI stable , at least within the ecosystem



7. type qualifier driven optimizations:

the qualifiers change throughout the code, the same expression have lead to different qualifiers, its ill-formed, but this makes uninitialized variables truly safe to use.

because the function either throws or initializes them, if not initialized it is an error.







8. reflection the verbosity away:

each namespace has an special function, implemented by default, it adds context objects to functions, and automates many of the verbose writing

for example  a var is stable const restricted safe and etc. by default,  no need to opt in , 

the reflection functions work on the AST , after all the de reflection Operations are completed,  the AST can fully turn into IR,

these operations can happen in parallel,  if they are located in separate dependency chains .

similarly the ABI hashing is also done in parallel  and cashed once completed based on dependency chain, although the `abiof` operator might make it happen sooner than usual. 







9. JIT `constexpr` code execution:

each function  even in its template form can be turned into IR , because mcc IR is different,  it has two types , `constexpr` IR and `mutexpr` IR ,

the borrow checking and lifetime management itself is `constexpr` IR with assertions.

`constexpr` IR is necessary  ran in the compiler , so , even if the template types are unknown,  the IR is generated to  retrieve the template type then de-reflect the type away in just-in-time generated IR.







10. unique programming and debugging experience:

The debugging would be in the context types ,

Async debugging is hard in other languages,  but seamless in c colon because the stack trace is automatically build in the context functions for debuggability when we unwind,

the explicit allocator problem in c++ is also eliminated , making using debug allocators easier, 

the contract violations are captured in the context object,  vs the static global violation handler function 

async destructors work with the `co_value` keyword  and much more.







11. easy to use package management with CPP like compile times:

like cargo , c colon has a package management system integrated in the tool chain ,

unlike header files and CPP files, c colon aims to be more modular , each file being a module, like c++ modules,  while allowing for static and dynamic linking of libraries like in c++,

each module has hashes of its dependent modules, to help cashing and compile times ,

because the AST can be converted to IR via JIT , the compiler can  use many cashing schemes for templated entities and namespaces 

, each component and modules in the package management system have precompiled some IR and AST steps , that make it easier for compilers to use them if more download speeds result in faster compilations , if not the compiler can do it by hand without IRs.









what i think will be the strategy in this language to make it easy



beginners:

avoiding most qualifiers and completely, sticking to using mut when necessary, 

sticking to value semantics, for functions,  `inout` , in , out  and non reference,  reference-like alternative that don't cause much confusion, 

and coping most things , occasionally using more complex code.

avoiding any borrowing and  unsafe.



developers who use libraries:

writing value oriented,  functional-like mutability avoiding code , knowing how to design easy to use APIs , with OOP and more to use 





library authors:

writing complex performant code that can be used easily using value oriented designs



low level library authors:

using the language  to its fullest,  writing effective and efficient code without worrying much about ABI braking, 

using the latest technologies and theories to develop code that can be understood well by the optimizer, 

writing utilities that help automate rust, c++ and other language bindings and more.

a note from Mjz86 on what to do in "c:":



try not to get boggled down with ways to make it faster,

it is rewarding,  but its hard, the easiest way to write safe code in both rust and c: is to do more functional programming ( E colon ),

try only focusing on what needs to be optimized before making it hard for yourself, 

the compiler isn't there to demand the best code ,  it's not bad to mostly write value oriented code,

those who get boggled down in mcc or rust lifetimes want speed , but c: isn't just about speed,

its about speed if you want it , yes, but its about easier libraries , and not needing to link everything statically like rust,

its about writing embedded code knowing that your const declared variable wont change or be casted to mutable ,

and about moving away from the burden of ABI legacy , from killing the standard library's networking proposal because its not gonna be ABI stable,

its about using a regex without saying that PHP's regex is faster.

considerations



with these goals in mind , i aim to improve this spec , to make it practical, i often start with over engineering things , then chop unnecessary additions, to make it more practical, as of right now , were in over engineering phase.

this ABI aims to have minimal compatibility with the Itanium ABI , such that an extern "c++" statement can make most code usable in a c++ platform,

 some concepts may be excluded from such inclusions , for instance , a c++ type's declaration must be expressible in c colon and vise versa .

definitions



value qualifiers



volatile / nonvolatile



a change, read or write in a volatile used region of memory may not be optimized out.

 volatile has to come with the unstable+unrestricted qualifiers , similar to other unsafe qualifiers , it is incompatible with them by design,
 reason being, what does even an  stable volatile value even mean? its paradoxical 





mut / const



a change, read or write in a mutable region of memory is allowed





unstable / stable





for a pointer p declared within a code region b to an stable const region of memory r, if a stable value const v loaded from address a originating from p is loaded from memory , then until the end of b , the expression `std::memcmp(std::addressof(v),a,sizeof(v))==0` must be true , otherwise the behavior is undefined( the definition is not in terms of pointer being unique , but in terms of meaning ).



 for a pointer p declared within a code  region b to an stable mut region of memory r, if a stable byte const v stored to address a originating from p is used , then until the end of b , the expression `v== (byte)*a` must be true , if not , a value has been stored to address a originating from p in b or by a function called in b who is given a non const-stable pointer originating from p , otherwise the behavior is undefined
 ( the definition is not in terms of pointer being unique, but the store permission,
 being unique to a group of pointers ).


 region b:
 for address P while P is within its lifetime L , B is over the lifetime L


 note:

 1. mut-stable is like restrict in c, but a const-stable is like a rust constant

 2. its dangerous ( unsafe(unrestricted-stable)) for stable values to be declared unrestricted, it is as if a c restrict isn't proven to not alias.



`thread_safe` / `thread_unsafe`:

 these qualifiers are typically used as indicators of whether or not something is safe to pass and use between threads , the default is , any stable variable is thread safe and otherwise  unsafe, the stable mut is exclusively owned , and so safe to pass around, however,  `std::rc_t<T>` overrides that , so in any async boundaries the c colon libraries can notice via reflection that a mutable thread unsafe variable is used, so they can disallow it.

 also , if a member  is thread unsafe in E: ( not C:) , because of the qualifier visibility ban , that qualifier cannot be overridden by using a thread safe type with an `aliasset`.



uninitialized /initialized



a read from uninitialized valued via unsafe pointer  is undefined and without it  ill formed, but an store is valid, and will make  the qualifier go away.





unrestricted / restricted



unrestricted disables the exclusive mutability borrow rule in the compiler.

 unrestricted often has to come with the unstable qualifier so explicit stable exclusive or unstable qualification is required.







`represent_cxx` ( default only in fundamental types  `cxx_T_t`)/ `no_represent_cxx`(default in any other type):

for this to be used  many rules need to be checked  to have a cxx compatible type , 

for example  the alignment must not be fractional and must be at least `alignof(cxx_char_t)`, 

these types must be representable under the Itanium spec, for example virtual classes with `represent_cxx` must follow the Itanium spec for ABI layout, and functions with this qualifier (such as virtual functions in the Itanium style v-table) must follow Itanium compatible calling conventions ,this requires some nasty trade-offs, for example , supporting unsafe interposition C colon and allowing two stage dynamic loaders ( the cxx one ignores mcc binary , the mcc one independently loads),
this deep divide between these two ecosystem's ABI is limiting performance for mixed language code ,
however , if we did use cxx, cxx did use lib unwind , so we paid for cxx and lib unwind and the whole std cxx lib. 
using cxx FFI is already unsafe , however mixing cxx and c colon types is highly discouraged.
and needs `unsafe(represent_cxx)`,  another thing is that the `abiof` operator cannot work on these types , the inclusion of these types in a non `represent_cxx` abi dependancy  mandates the use of `abi=`





`noaliastype` / `aliastype`



`aliastype` means that any store/load/modification through this type can influence types outside the alias set.





`mutexpr` / `constexpr`



a value declared `constexpr` is known at compile time.





`no_dll_comparable_address`(default)/`dll_comparable_address`(dynamic loader used Function and variable ( any symbol) qualifier):

 a function,  variable or storage space,  used in the dynamic shared  library, may have a different address to the static function, a `dll_comparable_address` mandates that the storage address is unique,

 comparing two variables with  `no_dll_comparable_address` may or may not change during the execution , also interposition is not allowed for these values.

 a symbol of `dll_comparable_address` definition  is required to be loaded before any c colon code executes,

this means that all linkable binaries with this qualifier  must be available when the program starts.

the addresses of these variables is overridden at load time , and the memory  section is set to read execute for the duration of the program. 



 `dllhidden(default)/dllexport/dllimport,interpositioned`( only on static symbols,  like functions or static variables): 

   makes the symbol an export/import for DLL linking by providing a symbol hash.

   also `dllhidden` is the default and removes the symbol  hash in the binary .
   there is an `unsafe(interpositioned)` qualifier that can use `set_interposition(fn,address)` to store ( memory  order release) function address on a global atomic static , using  the address-of on this symbol will load by a memory order of acquire,
   therefore the address  is controlled by developers.






storage qualifiers



- external storage:

the storage semantic is unknown.

- static storage:

this value is valid for the entire program.

- `thread_local` storage:

this value is valid while the current thread of execution is alive.

- automatic storage:

value is in stack , automatically destroyed.

- dynamic storage:

value is in heap, manually destroyed.

- register storage:

value's storage is valid in the currant expression, but the address may change at any time with relocation, but for a given unique owning reference to the register its the same

- opaque storage:

value's storage is somewhere , but its valid at least till the current block ends

- `nostorage` storage:

no address is given for the value





`refexpr` / `valexpr`



the address of a `valexpr` value may not be unique, the state may be used to represent other objects as well ,

its like `no_unique_address` in c++:

makes this member sub-object potentially-overlapping, i.e., allows this member to be overlapped with other non-static data members or base class sub-objects of its class. this means that if the member has an empty class type (e.g. stateless allocator), the compiler may optimize it to occupy no space, just like if it were an empty base. if the member is not empty, any tail padding in it may be also reused to store other data members.

also if reorder is possible , any padding bytes or invalid state may be used to represent such object,

if its a `std::flag_t` , even more possibilities are made , as long as other declared object's are preserved



`reorderable/not_reorderable`(struct/class qualifier )



we can do rust-like reorder optimization if this enabled



`offset_dependant/not_offset_dependant(default)/member_offset_dependant/member_not_offset_dependant(default)`(struct/class qualifier,and type qualifier):



a `not_offset_dependant` type is a type whose inner structs can be scattered in memory when accessed,

 specifically ,a pointer to a sub object cannot be used to reliably get to the main object by a subtraction of the offset (other than a base class to derived class cast).

 but `offset_dependant` objects can use the offset to gain a pointer to the main object.

`member_offset_dependant` objects are the ones that specifically can be used for casts by offset , base classes are `member_offset_dependant` by default.









`forceref` / `unforceref`



`forceref`  makes the reference a pointer-like type that hold the address of the referenced type ,

`unforceref` allows the reference to be a custom type , for example a const str& is more appropriate as a string-view like type than a reference to a string.





unaligned / aligned



the alignment of this type might be neglected





unsafe / safe



a value modifier that makes usage of this value an unsafe operation.





interface / final / virtual / nonvirtual



- virtual:

 a virtual type is

 a type pointer + virtual table pointer.

 any virtual inheritance , polymorphism and etc., has an owner , but every other reference to it's sub types is virtually qualified.

 because there are no virtual table/base pointers in the type, but offsets and function pointers in the table.

- `nonvirtual`:

 a type with no v-table

- interface:

 an empty type with a v-table and/or virtual bases

- final:

 a type with a v-table who's dynamic reference type matches the static type.





`noaliasset`/ `usealiasset`



`noaliasset` means the alias set of the type cannot alias the type,

for example `intn_t` can alias the `uintn_t` and `mintn_t` types , but `noaliasset intn_t` cannot.










borrowed / referenced / owned



- referenced:

object is borrowed elsewhere,object cannot be used.

-  borrowed:

can be used but does not drop.

- owned:

an owned object can use and must drop after use.




 `drop_on_throw/presist_on_throw,drop_on_ret/presist_on_ret,xvaluexpr, rvaluexpr/lvaluexpr , (i)(o)valuexpr`(function arguments qualifiers): 
 drop on X makes it so that the object is  when X , (`xvaluexpr` is unconditional drop),`rvaluexpr` promotes move semantics.
 `(i)(o)valuexpr` does the automatic `in(i)/out(o)/inout(io)/inval(none)` dropping semantic to the current reference or if trivial , via register 
 

determines the general usage and call convention in a function argument.

- `valuexpr` ( translates to `mut ivaluexpr`  or the `in-val` register):

a stable  mutable value that is initialized on the call site. the value qualification

- `ivaluexpr`:

a stable const value. the input qualification

- `ovaluexpr`:

a stable uninitialized mutable value that will initialize the caller argument after a successful call. the output qualification

- `iovaluexpr`:

a stable mutable value. the `inout` qualification
 






`qualiexpr(T V)/qualiexpr()` ( default):

an special qualifier.

 V itself has a type with its qualifiers, 

 the value of V can be changed by the `constexpr` code section by `qualiexprof(identifier)`  that access the V inside (needs to have `unsafe(qualiexprof)` , because E colon does not need this level of power).

 any function attempting to capture this qualifier inside its scope needs to be a template,

 however , the outside of scope qualifier checks can still be there without changing the function signature;

c colon code:

```

template<autoexpr T-outside>

...requires... consteval pre... consteval post...

template<autoexpr T-inside>

...requires...

 ...f( T-outside (<-optional) name (<-optional):T-inside,... )...;

T-outside is the complete outside type, the checks of the outside , however the T-inside is what the function body actually gets as the argument type of name, 

however if there is a dependency from T-inside to T-outside, the function is considered fully templated , but if not , the function body is considered to be non templated , but the function call site still does execute the requires clause, which may contain checks or info about the type,

for example , a safe function may need to get a sorted vector ,  but the vector cant really prove without O(n) ops that it is sorted ,  and we really don't want static overhead , 

we can now declare a qualiexpr(bool sorted_flag=false) , (the empty qualiexpr being recognized as not sorted), and declare that the class member has qualiexpr(bool sorted_flag=true) and any operation that preserves that invariant are valid, and therefore we can statically assert that a binary search is not undefined behavior.



```

 





---



function qualifiers



- async(...),debug(...),optimize(...): 
these don't really mean anything to the compiler , the are not  relevant to ODR ( the declaration is allowed to not include these while  the definition may) in c colon ,( not even used in the ABI hash), however E colon can put these, to allow the context-type to be implicitly changed via reflection to reflect that functions intent 
 for example  debug(std::debug::obfuscated) to do debugging in release or debug(std::debug::unwind) , to debug during unwind. 

- none(in terms of purity,default on dynamic calls or declared non visible symbols):
not having anything fancy at all.

- synth( the implicit is default on static definitions):
only static definitions can have synth qualification , the synth qualification either is ill-formed or transformed into the appropriate qualification on the abi hash, after the compile , the synth engine also spits out an info dump on every explicit (not implicit) synth it made  ,
explicit synth puts more effort to synthesize the best it can , if the step limit is exceed the program is ill-formed, while implicit synth involves less trial and is more conservative if the heuristics show its not looking good.
synth analyzes the function body and does the purity qualification automatically , however its purity is easily breakable if the developer just  does a single wrong thing,
the explicit synth is more appropriate for formal proof engines or similar things,
there can be a compiler flag to also info dump on implicit synth and that hits at missed static optimizations opertonities.


- `effectless`:

an evaluation of a function call is `effectless` if any store operation that is sequenced during the call is the modification of an object that synchronizes with the call; if additionally the operation is observable, all access to the object must be based on a unique pointer parameter of the function.
an `effectless`  expression must be composed of only other `effectless`  expressions.


- `weak_idempotent`:

an evaluation e is `weak_idempotent` if a second evaluation of e can be sequenced immediately after the original one without changing the resulting value, if any, and the program will behave as if the repeated count of this evaluation was irrelevant( in terms of contract assertions,  logging is a side effect that isnt relevant to the program flow).
any expression can be declared `weak_idempotent`.
however, the one qualifier per expression  on rule must still hold , meaning that a second evaluation of an `weak_idempotent` expression must result in the same qualifiers as the first one, adding to contract assertion safety .


- idempotent:

an evaluation e is idempotent if a second evaluation of e can be sequenced immediately after the original one without changing the resulting value, if any, or the observable state of the execution, an idempotent expression is also an `weak_idempotent` expression.

an `idempotent`  expression must be composed of only other `idempotent`  expressions OR must be casted via unsafe(as-idempotent) ( because some code that looks like it modifies really dose not, for example an i++ in an internal for loop) OR in the case of paring synth(idempotent) via compiler proof that it's IR block was idempotent , if none were true , the program is ill-formed



- `viewstate`:

a function f is stateless if any definition of an object of static or thread storage duration in f or in a function that is called by f is stable but not volatile qualified, 
no modifications to these values are allowed. 
an `viewstate`  expression must be composed of only other `viewstate`  expressions.

- stateless:

a function f is stateless if any definition of an object of static or thread storage duration in f or in a function that is called by f is const+stable but not volatile qualified, and is `viewstate`.

an `stateless`  expression must be composed of only other `stateless`  expressions.

- independent:

a function f is independent if for any object x that is observed by a call to f through an l-value that is not based on a parameter of the call, all accesses to x in all calls to f during the same program execution observe the same value; otherwise if the access is based on a pointer parameter, there shall be a unique such pointer parameter p such that any access to x shall be to an l-value that is based on p.

an object x is observed by a function call if both synchronize, if x is not local to the call, if x has a lifetime that starts before the function call, and if an access of x is sequenced during the call; the last value of x, if any, that is stored before the call is said to be the value of x that is observed by the call.


an `independent`  expression must be composed of only other `independent`  expressions or is casted as `independent` via `unsafe(as-independent)`.






- `unsequenced`:

indicates that a function is `effectless`, idempotent, stateless, and independent.

an `unsequenced`  expression must be composed of only other `unsequenced` expressions.

- reproducible :

indicates that a function is `effectless` and idempotent.

an `reproducible`  expression must be composed of only other `reproducible` expressions.



- `mostly_functional`: 

 a function f is `mostly_functional` if The    returned or output-ed value ( via out )  by a call to f depends exclusively on, The values of its direct function arguments,The values of any non-volatile global, static, or thread-local memory observed at the time of the call, The values of any memory locations pointed to by its arguments (provided those locations are not volatile).

  f performs no write operations to any memory location visible outside its own activation record, including, global, static, or thread-local objects, Memory pointed to by its arguments (even if the arguments are non-const pointers), but excluding out and `inout` argument's value. 
  and f performs no write accesses to volatile-qualified objects.
  `viewstate` and idempotent .
  a `mostly_functional`  expression must be composed of only other `mostly_functional`  expressions.
( basically gnu::pure if no `inout` is used) 



- `purely_functional`: 

 a function f is purely functional if The  returned or output-ed value ( via  out) by a call to f depends exclusively on The values of its direct function arguments , and   The values of any non-volatile stable constant  global or static objects observed

 and   f performs no read operations from non-volatile global, static, or thread-local memory that is mutable

 and f performs no write operations to any memory location visible outside its own activation record, including Global, static, or thread-local objects and Memory pointed to by its arguments ,even if the arguments are non-const pointers, 

 only the `inout` and out arguments are modifiable reference like arguments.

 and f and its callees performs no accesses to volatile-qualified objects.

 and f is `unsequenced`  .

   a `purely_functional`  expression must be composed of only other `purely_functional`  expressions.

 ( basically gnu::const if no `inout` is used) 


* note: throwing a trivially relocatable throw-value via a special hand crafted functional supporting context-types can still allow the throw expression to be `purely_functional` if the function is not `represent_cxx`, 
this is because  throw is not unwind based and doesn't use globals at all , and  can be used without any side effects nor pointer usage, if an exception is not possible , then use noexcept to complete the purity qualifications.

 

 

* these qualifiers have restrictions, for example a stateless function can only call other stateless functions a stateless function can only call other stateless functions in safe code, and cannot modify `thread_local` or `static` variables or access global non-stable mutable variables , many  of these qualified functions can only call functions that have these qualities. 





- `enumret`&`enumcatch`( this is implicitly given based on the type of the return,  if its an `enum` type with this specifier , then the function returning it would have this property)( function or `enum` type qualifier):

 `enumret` and `enumcatch` are similar to each other , but one applies to the normal return type , and one applies to the throw-value ( catching return type) ,

 both return pointers can have this property. 

 any function with these qualifiers  necessarily has to have a match expression in the call site ( or the catch site)( if throw-value  is this way , via operator catch(auto) , auto corresponding to the  `enum` entries) 
 
  * restrictions for  `enum`s specified of this use :
   all  `enum` entries must be continuous,if not the biggest and smallest one should not be more than 255 values apart  ,( if the number is specified) ,
   warnings or errors will be given in cases where big number of entries generate massive jump tables or missed performance, typically anything more than 32  entries gives a warning and anything more than 256 table entries ( accounting for both `enum`s of throw and return together) is ill-formed, not because of could , but should , if we need 2 lookups (only 1 if continuous) and more than 8*255+255 bytes ( non continuous max before ill-formed) ... we really aren't fast are we. 
  


 * definition of what  `enum` return and call means:

   the return pointer of that specific channel ( return or throw) would not be a pointer to the return address , instead,  it will point to a lookup table of return addresses,  corresponding to the `enum`  declaration order, that is handled in the return path.

   the way these functions are called ( necessarily having a match expression on the call site) makes it so that the return jump is to the match path corresponding to the `enum`  type,

   the table will be as big as the number of `enum`  entries.



- `noexcept/throws`:

`noexcept` means the behavior is undefined if the function returns to the caller using the catching return register.

-  `noreturn/mayreturn`:

`noreturn` means the behavior is undefined if the function returns to the caller using the normal return register.





- transactional memory ( optional to be implemented):

0. `atomic_cancel`,

1. `atomic_commit`, 

2. `atomic_noexcept`, 

3. synchronized, 

4. `transaction_safe`, 

5. `transaction_safe_dynamic`

6. transactional ( value qualifier)





- `fastdyncaller/fastdyncallee`:

  functions are `fastdyncaller` by default, 

  a `fastdyncaller` qualifier makes the dynamic call,  have no variables in the used set.

  a `fastdyncallee` doesn't do much to the function's dynamic signature,  but  the registers in the used set increase a lot.

 

 - `nodyncontract/dyncontract`:

 `dyncontract` ( default) allows a function's contract to execute in the call site based on the callers contract evaluation requirements. 
 an `in-val` argument is implicitly passed to make contract violation controlled. 



  * the `fastdyncaller` transformation :

 this is intended  for functions that want minimal register usage in the functions who use the dynamic call,

 usually smaller functions with less used  registers benefit from the `fastdyncaller` specification, but those with many moving parts who already have large register usage are better used with the `fastdyncallee` qualifier. 

 if F's address isn't stored or used , then the transformation code  is optimized away.

 the `fastdyncallee` , on the other hand  doesn't have a transformation in the function's assembly.





 ```txt 

 
// the `enum` ret and catch are similar , however they have a secondary lookup( often deduplicated across the link-unit )    table with all the offsets+ret pointing to RC ,then RC finally does a secondary jump lookup to the caller table  , this is only one of the many ways of doing this , and we havent even done callee-inlining the thrunk yet. 
    RC:

    

    restore the catching return  to the return pointer.

    jump to ret.



    RN:

 

   restore the normal return  to the return pointer

 

   ret:

  

  restore all registers specified as used in F in stack.

    jump to the return pointer.

    

    

     

     absolute value of (&contact_checked_F-&dyn F)

     dynamic F( where the dynamic pointer will point):



    save all  registers specified as used in F in stack.

    save both return pointers.

    set both return pointers to &RN and &RC.



    static F:

    

    F's code...

    

    contact_checked_F: 

    contract's code...    

    

    

   

   a call to &(dynamic F) is made through the function pointer.

   

```



the difference to `fastdyncallee` is :

```txt









absolute value of (&contact_checked_F-&dyn F)

dynamic F( where the dynamic pointer will point):

static F:

    

    F's code...

    





contact_checked_F: 

contract's code...    



```

exact mechanism of return pointers:



 conceptually,  we have 2 return pointers, 

 and or potentially table pointers,

 however,  most of these are offsets, 

 the real way we store them is in 4 cases( 2 and 0 being the most common) :

 

0. no tables( `enum` ret) :

 `return_ptr`= the absolute pointer to the return path, calculated via instruction pointer in caller.

 `catching_return_ptr`=   the relative offset of the absolute path to the return pointer.

 

 

1. `enum` normal return table, catching return:

`return_ptr`= the absolute pointer to the first return path. 

 `catching_return_ptr`=`table_pointer`= absolute address of the table.

  -  table: 

    contains reletive offsets to the paths, the pointer points to the first return offset( granteed as zero)

  `{catching_return_offset, nth_retuen_path_offset....}`.

     

2. `enum` catching table, normal return:

`return_ptr`= the absolute pointer to the return path.

 `catching_return_ptr`=`table_pointer`= absolute address of the table.

  -  table: 

    contains reletive offsets to the paths,the pointer points to the first catching return offset, the catching offsets are accessible via positive indexes to the table.

  `{ nth_catching_return_offset....}`.

 

3. `enum` catching table, `enum` normal return table:

`return_ptr`= the absolute pointer to the first return path.

 `catching_return_ptr`=`table_pointer`= absolute address of the table.

  -  table: 

    contains reletive offsets to the paths, the pointer points to the first return offset( granteed as zero), the catching offsets are accessible via  negative indexes to the table.

  `{...(-n)th_catching_return_offset, nth_retuen_path_offset....}`.

    

--- 

the symbol table and dynamic loader:

 any c colon symbol with `dllimport` or `dllexport` qualifier has its cryptographic 256 bit hash stored in the binary, 

 this is for dynamic linking and the dynamic loader to be able to load the DLL.





- c colon symbols are *not* interposition-ed by default :

0. we do not want the overhead of the global offset table(GOT) by default, as it takes a toll on all calls from shared libraries even those thar are never interposition-ed (see the shared libraries `CppCon` video).

1.  it has an uneasy coexistence with the c colon ODR.

2. it is rarely used and can be mimicked by a mechanism like cxx `set_terminate`.

3. GOT being writable during the execution of the program is a security  problem because of being able to change the common functions to do something malicious( glaring attack surface).

4. we do not want the overhead of the procedural lookup table by default.

 





---

 constant sharing :

 
- in function  arguments when a stable byte B with address A is trivially relocatable within its type, if passed as a stable constant , we can trivially copy it to address B , we know it will not get changed,  and we know the original value will not change until it gets relocated back ,

   but, we can still use that byte B within other *constant* arguments,  that's because :

   1. B is within its lifetime. 

   2. B will not change until the scope ends.

   3. we can assume that each time    we access a copy of B , that its as if we trivially relocated it from the original.

   4. its as if we propagate a const reference borrow without the stable address  

   5. the callee will not drop the exclusive in parameters  in any code path.





-  immutable data structures and CoW: 

  there are many benefits to such structures , especially in a value oriented language like C colon , and by extension ,E colon.

  there might be more incentive on doing these styles of data structures for data oriented designs. 







- strings :

   string types heavily benefit from both SSO and COW ,

   in C colon,  each string has to have an encoding, 

   the most common encoding is the utf8 encoding, the standard library  should strive to support this encoding and be up to date on the Unicode standard.

  because of the language safety rules,  we have both thread unsafe string types for single-threaded like strings and we also have thread safe strings, 

   however,  constant strings are different from mutable strings , so , these are specializations on the common standard basic string type,

   the format includes `std::(m)(z)(u)string` , for the:

   0. m:

   mutability , it is not allowed for this string type to use copy on Write on the current buffer of text.

   1. z:

   the string mut be null terminated. 

   2. u: 

   the string can be thread unsafe in the way it is reference counted   

   

 --- 

 coroutines:



- context-type in the signature:

instead of the default `std::context_t<optimization-level>`  use `std::async_context_t<optimization-level>`  ( or equivalent non standard types )

 

0.  has to have a `noop` coroutine function  :

   ```
   context-type-coro-return noop_resume( context-type-coro-input) context-type;
   ```

1. has to have a promise-type ( dependent on function signature ) declared inside it , the promise type is the callee facing context type , because the callee always knows its coroutine status, it can always know if its the context type or the promise type as the context type , on each resume , the promise type is refreshed with new caller facing context types , but the promise within manages the callee.

2. has to have a `context-type-coro-return` and `context-type-coro-input` ( independent of the function signature) to be returned from a resume.



3. the promise  function's :

  - first function  that is called once resumed ,the input is typically the callers coroutine handle and other information :

  

  `promise_resumed(this promise&  self, context-type-coro-input,in is_cancled) context-type-> promise-cache;`

   

- last function that is called resulting in suspension: 

  note that the reason for using references instead of `inout` here is because the callee will probably throw , resulting in the drop of `inout` , but references don't drop self on throw.

  `promise_suspend(this promise& self, promise-cache,bool& is_cancled )context-type->context-type-coro-return;`

 

- (a)symmetric transfer:

if a promise wants ( decided in the `awaiter` suspension via returned `transfered_handle` being `noop` or not ) to do a asymmetric transfer , instead of the `promise_suspend` , the `promise_transfer` is called, they should have the same context-type to be compatible, the return value is typically the  coroutine handle and other information:

`promise_transfer(this promise& self,promise-cache ,in transfered_handle,bool& is_cancled )context-type->transfered-context-type-coro-input;`





- cancelation grantees: 

 an error type in the catch scope is either a base of the empty cancelation token type , or its a base of the common violation token or isn't either , for cancelation and violation catches ( a catch with these types) unsafe(ignore-cancelation) and unsafe(ignore-violation) is applied , but otherwise its safe to do in the coroutine,  also the  catch(throw-value), equivalent to catch(...) in c++  is also unsafe(catch-all-tokens).

 so , the c colon libraries can distinguish if the throw is a cancelation or not and do the appropriate safe thing for E:

 

- destroyed only when everything is canceled and "done()".



- promise-cache :

the promise cache is an object only visible in the promise, with lifetime between resume and suspend ( therefore  may flow in registers), its accessible as an `inout` like object to most inner functions , its mostly because the promise type's storage is hard to optimize because the caller can get it, therefore,  this can be used for intermediate variables in the coroutine,  for example the caller handle , 



 - ABI :

  the coroutine handle  is a pointer to the structure with the following layout:

 ```C

 struct frame{

  context-type-coro-return (* resume_function ) ( frame* ptr, context-type-coro-input) context-type;// fastdyncaller , and  dyncontract  by default 

 intptr_t  program_switch_counter;// positive indexes show normal control flow, negative indexes show the same suspension's catching/cancelation control flow,  0 shows that the function and all of its variables will be destroyed on next suspension ( final suspend) .

 // if the function's last destination ( the counter being set to zero) throws by exception, the resume pointer will be reassigned to soly point to the frame deallocation destructor,  the frame wouldn't be destroyed,  but rather,  the exception would  be caught in the catch and stored on the stack  then the frame will finally be destroyed by calling the resume pointer again. 

 // if a the deallocation of the frame fails by exception the program will terminate ( we can assume free and delete will never fail so this isn't an issue) 

  byte[....];// coroutine frame storage 

  

  // the fastdyncaller transformation is a bit different for asymmetric transfer,  each jump to a sibling restores the used set as if it was a return. 





  };

    

 // these are simplified code , the actual code would check to see if its a noop coroutine first .

  // all of these are unsafe(explicit-coroutine-handles) . 

// bool    done() == (program_switch_counter==0 )

//note that a cancelation of a function is only observable while it hasn't  reached final suspension,  in the final suspend it had done all of its work so even if the resume throws an exception,  it has already been a finished routine. 

//  bool canceled() ==(program_switch_counter<0)

// it is necessary for safety that all coroutines are called with their context-type known ( context-type  is acting like the Itanium promise type)



// context-type-coro-return  resume(context-type-coro-input) context-type {return resume_function(ptr...);}

//  void cancel() {ptr->program_switch_counter=-abs(ptr->program_switch_counter);}// if there are no co_value expressions , then only one resume is necessary before its "done".

 // context-type-promise & promise() ...

  

   

   std::coroutine_handle_t<context-type, std::meta(^^coro-function)> is the non type erased handle , with superior static calls ( calling and optimizing via the reflection information) 

  , however the type erased one has an empty reflection value of  std::meta  , and does a dynamic call, and is needed for callees to preform the control transfer via resume on the caller.

```


---
 allocation and the as if rule:
  
  the  allocators ( defined via the `std::allocator_c` concept(s)) in mcc followed the as if rule ,
  if multiple allocations can be elided safety, they will,
  the allocators fall into two categories,  the ones that are thread-safe and the ones that aren't,
  thread-safe allocators are more expensive to use , although non thread-safe allocators can be used via channels , its still not a good choice.
 its similar to how cxx does coroutine frame Ellison, but this time the stack frame is also available. 








---

 references( there are more combinations of qualifiers  , but the common ones include )

 

 out/in/`inout` T:

 

a value oriented reference-like type ,

for function arguments,  these don't necessarily mean that T will have the same address,  unless T isn't trivially relocatable, which will make T relocate into the stack in the caller.



 T&:
(`lvaluexpr` is default)


a typical l-value reference like rust , and if unrestricted , like c++.

its like `inout`,for passing around T without potentially changing the address of T , unlike `inout`.


its const is used in the copy constructors.


`rvaluexpr T&`:



a typical r-value reference like c++ but borrow  checked like T&, and if unrestricted , like c++.

its mut is used in the move constructors. 



 


`iovaluexpr T&`:


a typical l-value reference like `inout` , this is the answer to `inout` like semantics without the intent to steal.

its like `inout`,for passing around T without potentially changing the address of T , unlike `inout`.


if a function throws by exception,  this value is considered dropped/uninitialized if T is mutable .

however if returned,  this value would still be considered in its lifetime. 






`xvaluexpr T&`:



a dropping reference (like r value or x value),  meaning that after the lifetime  of the `xvaluexpr T&` the entity will be dropped.

used in the relocation constructors.



non `forceref` user defined references:



are user defined types who's purpose is referencing variables. 







---







Itanium-like definitions:



the descriptions below make use of the following definitions:



- alignment of a type t (or object x): a value a such that any object x of type t has an address satisfying the constraint that &x modulo a == 0.



- base class of a class t: when this document refers to base classes of a class t, unless otherwise specified, it means t itself as well as all of the classes from which it is derived, directly or indirectly, virtually or non-virtually. we use the term proper base class to exclude t itself from the list.



- base object destructor of a class t: a function that runs the destructors for non-static data members of t and non-virtual direct base classes of t.



- basic ABI properties of a type t: the basic representational properties of a type decided by the base mcc ABI , including its size, its alignment, its treatment by calling conventions, and the representation of pointers to it.



- complete object destructor of a class t: a function that, in addition to the actions required of a base object destructor, runs the destructors for the virtual base classes of t.



- deleting destructor of a class t: a function that, in addition to the actions required of a complete object destructor, calls the appropriate deallocation function (i.e,. operator delete) for t.



- direct base class order ( if `not_reorderable`): when the direct base classes of a class are viewed as an ordered set, the order assumed is the order declared, left-to-right.



- diamond-shaped inheritance: a class has diamond-shaped inheritance if it has a virtual base class that can be reached by distinct inheritance graph paths through more than one direct base.



- dynamic class: a class requiring a virtual table pointer (because it or its bases have one or more virtual member functions or virtual base classes).



- empty class: a class with no non-static data members other than empty data members, no unnamed bit-fields other than zero-width bit-fields, no virtual functions, no virtual base classes, and no non-empty non-virtual proper base classes. such type can be declared with no-storage qualifier.



- empty data member: a potentially-overlapping non-static data member of empty class type. such type can be declared with no-storage qualifier.



- inheritance graph: a graph with nodes representing a class and all of its sub-objects, and arcs connecting each node with its direct bases.



- idea of the inheritance graph order:
when making the `castation-table` in the compiler we need to generate it via a graph treversal, to make it as if we did that treversal at runtime.
 the ordering on a class object and all its sub-objects obtained by a depth-first traversal of its inheritance graph, from the most-derived class object to base objects, where:

    - no node is visited more than once. (so, a virtual base sub-object, and all of its base sub-objects, will be visited only once.)

    - the sub-objects of a node are visited in the order in which they were declared. (so, given class a : public b, public c, a is walked first, then b and its sub-objects, and then c and its sub-objects.)

    - note that the traversal may be pre order or post order. unless otherwise specified, preorder (derived classes before their bases) is intended.



- instantiation-dependent: an expression is instantiation-dependent if it is type-dependent or value-dependent, or it has a subexpression that is type-dependent or value-dependent. for example, if p is a type-dependent identifier, the expression `sizeof(sizeof(p))` is neither type-dependent, nor value-dependent, but it is instantiation-dependent (and could turn out to be invalid if after substitution of template arguments p turns out to have an incomplete type). similarly, a type expressed in source code is instantiation-dependent if the source form includes an instantiation-dependent expression. for example, the type form `double[sizeof(sizeof(p))]` (with p a type dependent identifier) is instantiation-dependent.



- morally virtual: a sub-object x is a morally virtual base of y if x is either a virtual base of y, or the direct or indirect base of a virtual base of y.



- nearly empty class: a class that contains a virtual pointer, but no other data except (possibly) virtual bases. in particular, it:

    - has no non-static data members and no non-zero-width unnamed bit-fields,

    - has no direct base classes that are not either empty, nearly empty, or virtual,

    - has at most one non-virtual, nearly empty direct base class, and

    - has no proper base class that is empty, not morally virtual, and at an offset other than zero.

    - such classes may be primary base classes even if virtual, sharing a virtual pointer with the derived class.



- non-trivial for the purposes of calls: a type is considered non-trivial for the purposes of calls if:

    - it has a non-trivial realloc-constructor , or if its realloc constructors are deleted.

    - this definition, as applied to class types, a type which is trivial for the purposes of the ABI will be passed and returned according to the rules of the base mcc ABI , e.g. in registers; often this has the effect of performing a trivial reallocation of the type.

    - if non trivial,  it is passed as if it had a stable `forceref` (i)(o)valuexpr qualifier, as if  passed by reference,  the relocation is allowed to be optimized out if the passed variable is (i)(o)valuexpr qualified or is a temporary at the call site, note that if the variable has internal mutability  as an input , it is ill formed to pass it by value ( input) and its relocation constructors cannot be trivial.



- potentially-overlapping sub-object: a base class sub-object or a non-static data member declared with the valexpr qualifier.

- primary base class: for a dynamic class, the unique base class (if any) with which it shares the virtual pointer at offset 0.

- secondary virtual table: the instance of a virtual table for a base class that is embedded in the virtual table of a class derived from it.

- templated entity:

    - an entity that is defined or created within a template, such as:

        1. an instantiation of a class, function, or variable template, including from a partial specialization, but not including an explicit specialization;

        2. a member or friend function definition of a templated class;

        3. an enumerator of a templated enum;

        4. a local entity in a templated function;

        5. an entity within a templated namespace or

        6. a lambda in a templated entity.

- thunk: a segment of code associated (in this ABI ) with a target function, which is called instead of the target function for the purpose of modifying parameters (e.g. this) or other parts of the environment before transferring control to the target function, and possibly making further modifications after its return. a thunk may contain as little as an instruction to be executed prior to falling through to an immediately following target function, or it may be a full function with its own stack frame that does a full call to

the target function.



 - interposition :

  overriding a symbol in one binary fron another. 






- memory orders( similar to cxx) :

The default behavior of all atomic operations in the library provides for sequentially consistent ordering . That default can hurt performance, but the library's atomic operations can be given an additional `std::memory_order` argument to specify the exact constraints, beyond atomicity, that the compiler and processor must enforce for that operation.


1. Relaxed : there are no synchronization or ordering constraints imposed on other reads or writes, only this operation's atomicity is guaranteed (see Relaxed ordering below). 

2. Acquire: A load operation with this memory order performs the acquire operation on the affected memory location: no reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered before this load. All writes in other threads that release the same atomic variable are visible in the current thread (see Release-Acquire ordering below).

3. Release :A store operation with this memory order performs the release operation: no reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered after this store. All writes in the current thread are visible in other threads that acquire the same atomic variable (see Release-Acquire ordering below) .

4. acquire release :A read-modify-write operation with this memory order is both an acquire operation and a release operation. No memory reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered before the load, nor after the store. All writes in other threads that release the same atomic variable are visible before the modification and the modification is visible in other threads that acquire the same atomic variable.

5. sequencal consistency :A load operation with this memory order performs an acquire operation, a store performs a release operation, and read-modify-write performs both an acquire operation and a release operation, plus a single total order exists in which all threads observe all modifications in the same order (see Sequentially-consistent ordering below).


no changes  were really made  from [the c++26 definitions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order.html) , as its a great well-defined memory model that c colon stands on.




















- vague linkage: the treatment of entities -- e.g. inline functions, templates, virtual tables -- with external linkage that can be defined in multiple translation units, while the ODR requires that the program behave as if there were only a single definition.



- virtual table (or v-table): a dynamic class has an associated table (often several instances, but not one per object) which contains information about its dynamic attributes, e.g. virtual function pointers, virtual base class offsets, etc.

- virtual table group: the primary virtual table for a class along with all of the associated secondary virtual tables for its proper base classes.





 layout:

 

in what follows, we define the memory layout for c colon data objects. specifically, for each type, we specify the following information about an object o of that type:



- the bit-size of an object, `bit_sizeof(o)`;

- the bit-alignment of an object, `bit_alignof(o)`; and

- the bit-offset within o, `bit_offsetof(c)`, of each data component c, i.e. base or member,
note that a dynamic class cannot have fractional alignment  for its bases, if it does , the program is ill-formed 




virtual table layout contains:





- type-v-table( 64 byte aligned) :

  0. `castation-table`( used in dynamic cast) :

  we have the search table , to do a binary search,  for each type , there might be a different lookup table depending on class visibility and the hagiarchy,

  but , for this type , all the accessible types are in the lookup, this , although taking up more space,  is more efficient than a graph traversal algorithm at runtime,  either way, it is already a bad practice to do dynamic inheritance, and most things would be resolved via `enum` types anyway, with simplicity , and more safety

  

```



struct {



// the 256 bit hashes aren't 256 values , instead we have a martrix pointer , truncated-count ( max of 32) arrays of  big endian bytes , the reason for this is presented in the dynamic cast spec.

(sorted-cryptographic-256bit-hash-of-dest-types-name-mangle-byte(*)[number-of-types])  [32/* hash bytes*/];// note , if the hashes are unique when truncated ( very often the case ) the least amount of bytes of hash is used while still keeping every hash's value in the table is unique 
 bit pack of <number-of-types, truncated-count>;// between 1 and 32 is truncated-count, as a 5 bit , and rest of the bits are for number-of-type
type-v-table-of-dest-types* (*)[number-of-types]

}

  a virtual reference is :

virtual table pointer

and

type pointer







- dynamic cast( a cache-friendly binary search , instead of a graph traversal in itanum) :

  we first  do a binary search for the lowest and highest  most significant  bytes  with equal value to the most significant bytes from the cast destination.

  if the value is not found we return nullptr ( range is empty) , if only one value in range , we use that index for getting type v table , then if our hash is  not equal to hash-of-current-types-name , we return nullptr , else, then use the offset to get the pointer,  else:

  we do a binary search  on the next most significant bytes , similar to the first step.

  we do this loop until we either reach the hash , or we get nullptr or , if  all the truncated-count ( max 32)  bytes are searched,  we return nullptr.

  * the reason for doing this unusual storage of hash:

    when we search , each time we do so , we search for the byte , and in each section,  the bytes are next to each other , so 64 bytes (64 bases) can be easily searched through without a cashe miss , and in most cases,  we have few bases , so , the first steps , which are the most likely to find the hash in ( cryptographic hashes are uniformly distributed, so in 256 bases ( which is a lot) we are likely to have 1 to 5 bases, so the next step will likely resolve the search ).

    also ,either way we will need to access the offset anyway,  and because of the 32 byte alignment , we know that ( assuming 64 byte cache line) we only access one cache line to get both the offset , and the 256bit hash to check equality with to see if we have a match.

    this strategy helps mitigate the binary search cache miss penalty. 

    if the number of bases are less than 64 , we most likely have only 3 cache lookups ( 1 for the first search step , and assume the first step is successful, another one for the  v table lockup  , and last one for check and pointer offset lookup)
    
    in practice most structures have less than astronomical base counts , truncated-count helps to reduce all that 256 of precision,  untill we reach a  sorted set that will lose uniqueness as soon as we truncade more , gaining  the same speed with  equivalent functionality and practically fewer bytes in the table.

    truncated-count is the minimum value that it can be , while having each truncated-hash in the table unique.

calling convention:



the gist is ,

The caller can store values into registers that the callee has promised to not modify, 

To reduce stack spills,

to reduce spills , the function signature should also require minimal usage ( that's where overlap optimization comes in) and also ,

for reducing braching , most of the branches known in the callee to occur at call site have been moved to the return branch in the callee , the callees return acting like a switch statement to the caller code, but because the return is already a necessary dynamic branch , the cost of 2 branches ( return , and a check of return calue in callee) is reduced  to one.

also , because of the lifetime problem( understood in rust dyn calls with lifetime signatures that convert to other signatures) in dynamic calls , any call through a dynamic  function pointer or dll  has either provable valud lifetimes or is unsafe(lifetime-dyn-call) or  for casting between lifetimes using unsafe(lifetime-cast)



a mcc signature has:



return-type function-mangled-name ( arg-type-(in/out/`inout`) args... ) context-type (noexcept/throws) (noreturn/mayreturn) ( other-function-qualifiers);



- note:



the context type is as if its an `inout` argument.



the throw-value specified in the context type is as if its an out argument, this out argument  can overload with any other arguments except the context object, because this is the only out argument other than the context object that is preserved  in a unsuccessful call to a function, as a result  this often overlaps with the return argument, however a non trivially relocatable throw value will need to be passed via a non overlapping  throw-value-pointer input, for this reason it is discouraged that throw values be non trivially relocatable.



the return type is as if its an out argument.



there are special registers:



1. the stack pointer and the base pointer (callee saved):



stack pointer is like itanum , except the base pointer is a register, the caller can assume its value is the same after the call, usually some optimizations might use other stratch registers as base pointer as well ,but this one is special because it isn't used through a fastdyncallee dynamic call.



2. the instruction pointer (caller passed, no save):



like itanum



3. the normal return address (caller passed, no save):



the return address to the happy path section in the caller.

 if specified `enum` return , its the table pointer to the table of return entries corresponding  to each `enum` entry.



4. the catching return address (caller passed, no save):



the return address to the unwind/sad path code section in the caller.

if specified `enum` return , its the table pointer to the table of return entries corresponding  to each `enum` entry catch path.





( only 5 pointer sized registers, 2 of which are already used in all architectures for that purpose)

( the other 3 can be pushed before general purpose use and poped/re assigned when needed at the call boundaries to reduce register pressure when register utilization is too much)



a function's manipulated registers come in 5 categories ( aside from special ones):

1.  in ( const in argument ) :



cannot  be written to by callee, only read from .  

 

2.  in-val ( mut in argument ) :



categorized among in, but with ability to write.

can be written to by callee, and read from but its undefined if the caller reads these after the call , except when initialized again.



3.   out:





cannot be read from by callee( before the initialization),

and must be written to at some point in callee.







4.  `inout`:



free to read or write,

once the callee throws , this value is considered dropped by the caller.





5. used ( scratch registers),(caller saved):



may be read from after initilization or written to  , but its undefined if the caller reads these after the call , except when initialized again.







important note: 



 in and out registers may overlap in the calling convention , this doesn't mean that they will be `inout` , only that the registers who are used for input purposes, will have output purposes after the call,  because its faster as an `inout` amd has less register pressure.



any registers not used or not in any signature is unused ,

any register not needed after a call , or a fastdyncallee dynamic call doesn't need to be saved ,unless proven better by compiler.

for example if i do a call to a fastdyncallee dynamic function in an almost empty function, no registers are saved , only the function will have many used registers.



a function signature , or a function pointer type will determine the :

in , out, and `inout` registers.





- in the rare occasion  of using all registers for parameter passing , the caller pushes arguments to the stack , the caller is responsible for the cleanup of the out and `inout` parameters,  but the callee is responsible for the in parameter cleanup. 



- the registers allocator priority goes like( lower means more priority for being in a registers):

1.   all `inout` registers  ( including the ones made implicitly via the overloap of in and out registers).

2.  all out registers. 

3.  all in-val registers. 

4. all in registers. 



- after stable sorting of arguments based on in/out/`inout` the stack arguments are pushed onto the stack from right to left.



 - the responsibility of cleanup of stack variables:
 these arguments are cleaned up by the caller. 

 the reason is that the caller might read these `inout/out` ( while in and in value are unneeded, its faster if there was only one responsibility ) so they do  need cleanup by the caller.

 these arguments are allocated on the stack before assignments of the stack pointer  to the base pointer of the callee.
 







* the unsafe(dyn-args) dynamic variading functions  :
 printf in C is one of the examples, although these functions are unsafe and therefore  bad practice to write.









the used registers set is :



for a fastdyncallee dynamic function call ( through a function pointer or a dll call) : 



all the registers not used in the signature ( except for the base pointer register and other special registers), so the callee's function pointer  is as if it was to its static call , but ,all the callers who use this function have the burden of saving intermediate values into the stack.



for a fastdyncaller dynamic function call  ( through a function pointer or a dll call) : 



no registers are in the used set , this means that the callee  saved all the callee used registers in the dynamic transformation code,  so the caller is free to assume that all  registers not in the function signature are preserved,  making the caller more performant and reducing caller code size.

for a static call:



all registers used in the callee and through the function call .



a used registers is a registers whose value is potentially modified, but the initial value is not restored in the function call to be used after the call.



for example, a push of r and a pop of r at the end in return means r is restored so r is not a used register, even though it might be modified.



a formal description might be:



a registers who's observed values before the call might be different after the call , in at least one code path.





- dynamic function contract tracking:

any dyncontract function who's address is captured for dynamic calls must have a pointer-sized function pointer before the function's code itself. 

this function pointer is the contract checked F pointer , it points to the contract handler,

the contact handler checkes the pre or post conditions of a function, based on an implicit  in-val argument  that contains:

0. check the pre vs check the post bit.

1. expected contact violation semantic of caller.



- more explanation:



this set grows linearly until the registers load is too high , then for these registers , the caller stores them to stack and pops back after return from calle, this makes sure there is minimal stack usage,



( because the register assigner is used after the main optimization passes and in the linker, any recursive graph can be known to store the registers in stack)

 

however because fastdyncallee dynamic/external calls don't have the luxury of known assembly, so ,

every register might be used , so , the intermediate registers need storing before the fastdyncallee dynamic call and re storing afterwards, just like how the call and ret instructions work via stack push and jumps, or how the c++ async resume and suspend is defined via jumps,

this is just more explicit, because we have no control over what call instruction saves but we do for ret.



there are also 2 return paths ,

instead of a branch after a call like most std::expected, we do an optimization, not valid in c, that isn't try catch with cold paths , but ,

the caller happy paths have no need for a branch because a throw will return to the catch path in the caller from the catch register address, this is also very fast , like a single return statement, and the only cost is that a register is occupied , not bad compared to throw , or even the if statement in my opinion



this is also possible because of the radical exception handling mechanism ( a statically known context type specified in the function signature, to be the vessel for the allocators,exception handling, debugging and stack trace information in debug builds , and maybe other information, this means that the exception type is statically known , unless abstracted away by a std::any-like object in the context type, also the debugging could be more information rich , for example skipping unnecessary name mangles or helper functions , because the debugger is just code with some trap brake points),

basically i don't need to tell about all of it , but every function has any catch statements or raii clean up codes in the catch path , this doesn't need any extra unwinder, because there is no data structure for the unwinder, it's just code , and the return is directly to the unwind code instead of calling many cxx throw functions and using thread local or dynamic storage



this also makes reverse engineering way more difficult, which is a good thing for those who want a program with no debug info to be uncrackable, although not a goal , this is a side effect of using registers in unconventional ways.



note that this ABI is fully abstractable under Itanium , basically, only the outer functions needs itanum for compatibility,

at most the catching return points to a cxx throw for compatibility.



note that , as far as i know, the call and ret instructions already store much unnecessary registers in the stack, so i dont think the dynamic overhead is much different from a normal dynamic call ,

also , i believe that allowing the return , arguments and more be able to expand , be even simd registers is far more beneficial than a restricted set of registers as function arguments and a single return registers, let alone the catch register



there might also be optimizations:



```txt

f:

init:...

code:...

if ... jump to happy

(throw code ...)

move catch ret register to normal ret .

( this will make the return at the end a throwing return)

jump to clean

happy:

....

clean:

....

end and ret:

....

ret to normal ret

```

instead of duplicated cleanup code in happy and sad paths in the c++ throw conversions, or returning to an unnecessary brach that is known to be happy or sad in the calle.



in x86 specifically ,some things to note is that , while x86 has like 1024 bytes of zmm registers, its all caller saved in itanum , so... the compiler often wont use their full potential even in static calls, it is already not used ,

and with the movement towards less virtual calls and more compike time polymorphism, the gains might be very beneficial.



also, even at worse cases of using all 1024 registers , at most we do 16x2 simd zmm load and stores , although, i still believe that with the amount of avoidance of the people from dynamic calls, the overall optimization will be worth it , even if it costs 32 simd instructions in the virtual call site.



an important consideration is comparing the dynamic call to the call instruction,

any register necess



ary after the call is either:

special( like sp,ip)

pushed in the call sub instructions,

or

pushed before the call instruction.



even tho the call instruction is faster than pushing them manually, the registers are still being spilled to the stack , so in every case , a dynamic call necessarily has to store the registers necessary in the stack .

all we did was , for static calls, reduce the burden of the runtime to the link time analysis.



--- 

 enum/pattern matching functions:

 a function returning an `enum` type , depending on the enum-type's properties can fall into two categories:

 

 - normal control flow: 

 the `enum` type doesn't have any match specifier 

 

 - `enum` control flow:

  the `enum` type returned dictates what caller return address entry the callee jumps to .

  this is especially useful because many throw-values are enums of :

  0. many violation exceptions.

  1. many cancelation tokens.

  2. many user code exceptions.



  but often the return pointer doesn't need indirections because often the return is not an enum.

  



--- 

(de)initilization sequence of modules:
the module constructor that runs :
0. fetch add 1  to the initilization atomic  and if it was not 0 at the beginning, return.

1. all the dependant modules get initilized.

2. all the static variables get initialized in order of declaration.


program code: 

3. the main function in the module will run if defined.
 
 
 the module destructor that runs :
4 .fetch sub 1 to the init atomic , if it didnt went to zero , return. 

5.    destroy every static variable in the reverse order of declaration and deinitilize each module that we initilized.



 



*  in a dll initilization the loader has different work to do , so the first step is loading , and after the destruction theres unloading.

namespace and header



this ABI specifies a number of type and function apis supplemental to those required by the c colon standard. a header file named mccabi.h will be provided by implementations that declares these apis. the reference header file included with this ABI definition shall be the authoritative definition of the apis.



these apis will be placed in a namespace `__mccabiv1`. the header file will also declare a namespace alias ABI for  `__mccabiv1`. it is expected that users will use the alias, and the remainder of the ABI specification will use it as well.



in general, API objects defined as part of this ABI are assumed to be extern "c:". however, some (many?) are specified to be extern "c" or extern "c++" if they:



- are expected to be called by users from c/c++ code, e.g. `longjmp_unwind`/throw/...; or

- are expected to be called only implicitly by compiled code, and are likely to be implemented in c/c++.

 module dependency resolutions:  

  each file , has many kind of cached compiler outputs relevant to it in the build directory.





  0. import modules :

    lists all the modules imported from this file.



  1. export modules:

    lists all the modules exported from this file.

  

  2. import identifiers:

  lists all the identifiers and a reference to their relevant AST/IR code exported from this file.

  

  3. export identifiers:

  lists all the identifiers and a reference to their relevant AST/IR code  imported from this file.

  

 4. identifier contents(AST & JIT-IR &  IR & binary) :

 lists all the identifiers and their relevant AST/IR/asm code,

 also , each of the identifiers lists who their dependancies. 

 this includes but is not limited to : call graph, reference graph,  ABI graph, static variables used, register pressure, optimization qualifier and  etc.

 

  5. import library:

  lists all the dependancies from the web C colon repository. 

  6. export library: 

  lists all the dependancies that will be build for  the web C colon repository. 

 

 

 

 

  - type and function identifier categories:

    

    0. non templated:

    these are straightforward to make a graph of.



    

    1. full template specilization:

    these are similar to that of a non template in the graph contributions. 

    

    2. partial template specializations:

    these are similar to that of an overload set.

    

    3.  template overload set ( set of templates and non templates with this name):

     because templates in c++  and similarly C colon are turning complete  , we cannot determine if the template graphes will end their cycles or not ,

     so , for the resolution of this , we first need to resolve all the dependancies by execution of the `constexpr` IR-JIT code, the IR code will build the graph during its execution, 

     if the step count doesn't exceed,  then we have the  the graph in all templates being specialized,  and so being usable.

     while non specialized  templates are hard to parrarelize ,  the non dependent parts of the global graph can still run their template resolutions in parallel. 

 

  dependency graph building:

   for each part of the system,  we have a node in a dependency graph ,

   we start from parts where theres  no dependency and propagate to the nodes where the dependancies are resolved, 

   each time a template's full non template/specialized dependancies are resolved,  it  tries to resolve the rest via `constexpr` execution,

   this is repeated till we either reach max evaluation step or we resolve all identifiers to move to the next step.

compatibility



- extern "c:" :

 the function has c colon ABI , no restrictions.

- extern "c++" :

 the function signature, should have types that are not reorderable , templates that are valid in c++ , and structures consistent of only fundemental cxx types , this will be more exactly specified in next revisions,

 these functions have large thunks, although,  most of it is deterministic,  and the cxx throw and catch is already bloated anyway.

 - extern "c" :

 very bare bones , only fundemental types, trivial structures and pointers .

 these functions have large thunks, similar to the fastdyncaller transformation, because of unknown usage set,

 however c style function pointers ( similar to cxx ones) are mandatory fastdyncallee,  because  obviously we cannot assume anything about the assembly. 

 
- syscalls :
 theres an unsafe low level syscall trunk to allow talking to the OS  
 

-  trunks for dynamic calls with specific calling conventions:

context object:

 the context type satisfying the standard context concept  is a central hub for all things that were previously in thread-local or static storage, 
 the context-type is implicitly initialized by the callees context type via,
 in the debugging environment  every action , would probably have to go through the context-type, but this really helps make everything that is implicit controlled and optimized.
  almost all of these are inlined , especially the ones handeled in the callee. 
  if the type of context-type  of an inlined callee function maches the caller,  and the context satisfies the elidable context concept,  the compiler is allowed to treat the callee context as if it was the caller context, and not call the context making or checking operators,
  debugging contexts however cannot be inlined.
 
 
 - operator context( out callee-context-type )caller-context-type :
 constructs the context type of the callee before the call,
 in a debugging environment,  this can have conditional trap instructions. 
 
 - operator ~context( callee-context-type ) caller-context-type :
destructs the context type of the callee after the call,  potentially handing rich unwind information.
in a debugging environment,  this can have conditional trap instructions. 
 
 * note: caller and callee are both protective in the caller and callee respectively.
 
 
 - operator  caller (  callee-pointer or backend-hash  (depending on  dynamic call vs static call), stack-size,stack-pointer, instruction-pointer, argument-sttack-size)callee-context-type :
in the caller , before the call , the context-type gets a chance to caputure the protection information of the function if it wants to, to protect against stack overflow, and a minimalistic debug info for the stack trace.
in a debugging environment,  this can have conditional trap instructions. 

 
- operator  callee  (  backend-hash , stack-size,stack-pointer, instruction-pointer )callee-context-type :
in the callee , before the callee code and stack get initialized, the context-type gets a chance to caputure the protection information of the function if it wants to, to protect against stack overflow, and a minimalistic debug info for the stack trace.
in a debugging environment,  this can have conditional trap instructions. 

- `operator make_meta ( inout std::meta )->meta-input `, `operator make_meta ( inout std::debug_meta )->meta-input`:
a `constexpr` function that makes the meta type based on static reflection information, 
it also can be used to insert canaries and other safety features in debugging,  the output is given to runtime to be used .

- operator  meta ( meta-input )callee-context-type :
 just right after the callee operator this will execute if defined ( if the debug meta is captured,  the context becomes a debugging context , with limited optimizations( almost having very value an exact address offset to the stack pointer or heap allocation begin),  but with immense debugging knowledge),  giving rich debug info to the context type.
in a debugging environment,  this can have conditional trap instructions. 


there is an operator to declare a new context for a code block,
also one to get a reference to a context-type. 

- operator set(constructor-args... )main-context-type->block-context-type:
if set is used in the context,  it creates a code block output the main context , this can be an opt out of debugging for example. 
```
set_context<block-context-type>( constructor-args...){
.....
...get_context(...);
}
```

- operator get(...)context-type -> implementation-defined:
to get the context type with an expression.






- throw-value:

the value that is returned via the catching return address. 

 propagated through the operator catch .

 this is highly encouraged to be trivially relocatable.







- operator throw(self,...) noexcept -> throw-value:

this operator is used when the contexts scope uses the throw operator.
its mandatory that this function is noexcept beacuse, only the void context object can be in the throw signature, although, the throw has access to its context object by a function pram.
this function generates the throw object that is propagated to thr callers catch.
in a debugging environment,  this can have conditional trap instructions. 


- operator catch(self,callee-throw-value,...) context-type:

this operator is used when the contexts scope has an expression resulting in a call that might unwind by exception.
it is usual for this operation to throw an exception to the outer context object , note that , if a destructor throws in an unwind , the context-type may have been already filled with exception information , it is rare that this happens but often implementors terminate in such cases.
uaually specified noreturn, if not the user might struggle writing code.
in a debugging environment,  this can have conditional trap instructions. 


- operator try (out catched-value-in-catch-scope)context-type:
 often if the value is not convertable to be catched in the scope , it will throw to unwind to the rest of the code/ catch blocks.
the two standard context types are :
default support is for common exception string and `enum` categories , and   the common cancelation  and violation tokens,
however on lower levels , stack traces would get richer , and the exceptions would be paired with origin and specific lines of unwind it went through,
what objects did the violation and more 
in a debugging environment,  this can have conditional trap instructions. 

-`std::context_t<optimization-level>` :
this context type is used in synchronous programming,  specifically designed for an optimization level,
the lower the level the more debugging friendly is it.

- `std::async_context_t<optimization-level>` :
this context type is used in asynchronous programming ( paired with the std::scheduler<...>) ,  specifically designed for an optimization level,
the lower the level the more debugging friendly is it.


- `std::debugging_trap_handler( std::trapped_debbug_info_t info)fastdyncaller noexcept `: 
 captures standardized  debugging info on the trap instruction ,
 then hands control flow to the debugger, this symbol is `unsafe(interpositioned)`  .
 the debugger  may use `set_interposition(std::debugging_trap_handler,address)`  in a concurrent debugging thread , to overridde this symbol,
 the debugger may pause the execution of only this or all thread, to inspect the debug context,
 or if the debugging has specific conditions for triggering , overring this with the checker vs trigger  for those conditions is an excellent choice to not slow down all execution.

 contracts :

 

- a contract is an `weak_idempotent` expression that is used as a way to show validity of the current environment state.



-  there are different types of contract executions:



1. dynamic execution:

  

   a nodyncontract has no contact checked version. 

 

  a  dyncontract   function itself  has a  mandatory requirement  for a contract check in the `contact_checked` section of its assembly 



   the dynamic  callee may already have contract checks as a requirement, so , the two versions might be identical (  the function  pointer being the same or at most using a signle jump to the signature)if the callee is checked. 

   

   the caller uses either the checked version or the optimized version based on its contact requirement environment.

   

   

2. static execution:



usually the contract calling code is only repeated once in  the call site if any of the callee or caller contact requirement environments mandates it.



- diffrent types of `contract_assert`:
 

1. pre :


 in a pre expression of function
 note that this contract code is under the callee context-type 

2. post:

 in a post expression of function
 note that this contract code is under the callee context-type 

3. explicit:

 in a `contract_assert` expression of function

4. implicit:

in a  operation that might result in assertion like  a/0,a<<-1,a+maxint
note that this contract code is under the callee context-type  if its in a post or pre condition.
if the contract is implicit and not assumed or enforced, the value given after is an erroneous value, it is explicitly not correct,  however its not UB to read.







- what diffrent types of contract violation semantics do , when violation happens:

1. enforce :

results in calling the `operator contract_assert`.

2. quick enforce :

results in calling the terminate function.

3. ignore ( unsafe(contract-ignore)):

does nothing,  the check is elided at runtime however implicit contracts might not be elided perfectly because of erroneous behavior.

4. observe :

results in calling the operator `contract_assert`.

5. assume( unsafe(contract-UB) ):

results in undefined behaviour on violation, but the benefit  is that the check is elided at runtime and leads to compiler optimizations in compile time.





`operator contract_assert(...)  context-type` :

- gets called when a contract violation occurs 





- uaually specified noreturn , if not theres a chance that it ignores the violation.







---



fundemental types



- `std::(m/u)intN_t`:

 N  goes from 1 ( fractional alignment, with math similar to c bit feilds) , 2 , 4, 8 ( byte aligned) , 16,....up to at least 1024 ( the 11 power of 2 starting feom the 0th power)  , while unnecessary, its better to have reliable deafults, especially  because  modorn cpus have massive registers.

 

 1. nothing:

 overflow is a contract  violation, is a signed integral.

 2. u :

 overflow is a contract violation, is an unsigned integral.

 3. m :

 any overflow is well-defined, only devision by 0 is a contract violation,is unsigned modular arethmatic type.



- `std::(s)(b/eEmM)floatN_t`:

4, 8, 16,  32,64,80, 128

 

floating point types with N bits.

 also , s stands for stable, as in , the floating point math is platform independent,  although slower.



- `std::charN_t`:

N is one of 8,16,32,64

charechter types with N bits.



- `std::nullptr_t`:



type of a nullptr, its size is similar to a byte pointer.



  

- `std::bool_t`(1 byte) ,`std::flag_t`(1 bit) :

  the bolean types 

  

-  `std::bit_t`:

the special bit type with special pointers and references , `sizeof(bit_t)` and any types with fractional alignments ( and therefore  sizes) are ill-formed,  instead,  `bit_sizeof(T)`,`bit_alignof(T)`can be used, also , the bit can alias all types with any  alignment.

 





- `std::byte_t`:

the special byte type with the alias set of all types (with non fractional alignment, although it can alias the memory holing it).



- `std::abi_t`:



 the hash type that the abiof operator gives.

 its a 128 bit uuid , it doesn't support any operations outside of the ABI operators,  other than the usual load and store or casts.

 for example,  the hash given by xxhash128. 

  this is good enough,  because the linker already has to append the cxx-style name mangle to the hash .

   `namenangle__hexed-hash`. 



- `std::cxx_(wchar/...)_t`:



 cxx compat types.













* pointer types are different: 



`(memcast<uintmax_t>(bit_ptr)&~7)==8*memcast<uintmax_t>(byte_ptr)`.

 



0. c colon typical pointers( default ) : 

 these point to types with non fractional alignments

 most types do not have fractional alignment.

 these are typically cxx pointer sized 

 

 2.   c colon fractional pointers: 

  these point to types with fractional alignments, the reason is to make common bit feilds and flag  vectors easy.

  these are cxx  pointer sized in many cases ( 64 bit ptrs are big enough, however 32 bit ones will reduce the memory map 8 simes!, so  its not big enough)

  

 3. cxx pointers: 

 these are cxx compatible pointers  with cxx pointer sizes , pointer to any `represent_cxx` type.

  

  

  ---



limits



the architecture must have at least 5 pointer sized registers.

while possible for a very obscure architecture to use static variables as  registers , 

the design's focus on extreme register utilization might mitigate the gains ,

however,  modorn architectures have more than enough registers at their disposal. 

note that in architectures where `sizeof(cxx_char_t)!=1` , the `represent_cxx` is provided  to be used in ABI boundaries .

and for any cxx pointer `(memcast<uintmax_t>(byte_ptr)&~(sizeof(cxx_char_t)-1))==sizeof(cxx_char_t)*memcast<uintmax_t>(cxx_ptr)`, note that the lower bits in the c colon pointers in these architectures indicate shifts.



- hash sizes:
any implementation may choose hashes with size bigger or smaller than 256 or 128 



---
   debugging  :
   
  with current debugger technology, if the context-type satisfied the debugging concept,  the compiler will make code much less optimized, 
  will do little use of  cache friendly reordering , and will implicitly  ( through reflection) give the context-type very granular information using implicit calls providing reflection information and dynamic information ,
  most values will be lifted to stack for traceability,  this is extremely slow , and that's the reason that it only happens in scopes where context-type is mandating it ,
  this can help separate the binary debug vs release building model into function by function or module by module debugging 

  

  

---



 ABI  and compatibility



- the abi@() operators:

1. `abi+(t/abi_t)`:

adds the hash as a sult to the ABI hash of the apllied expression.

2. `abi=(t/abi_t)`:

sets the has as the ABI hash of the apllied expression.

3. `abiof(type/id)`:

gets the ABI hash off the inner expression.

- the ABI hash of a type:

1. is based on its definition and declaration order.

2. name mangle of expressions

3. ABI hash of sub expressions.

4. non static member ABI hash and dclaration order

5. virtual function ABI hash and declaration order

6. virtual bases ABI hash and declaration order

7. bases ABI hash and dclaration order

8. abi+(...) es ABI hash and dclaration order

9. qualifiers of a type , but order independent

10. throw-value  and promise-type and input and output of async/sync functions of the context

11. the ABI version number ( any changes to the ABI scheme in the standard will alter this number) 

12. diffrent trivially properties of a type.

13. lifetimes of  arguments or members and their dependancies ( the tokens and their hash in the definition of templates , lifetimes, contracts and requirements)





- note :

the c colon linker only uses the ABI hashes as signaturs for linkage.



- choice of hash:

 because,  the hashes are only relevant for a function/type/namespace... with a specific name ( similar to the uniqueness of  name mangles in Cxx) , and the specific hash ,

 lets say a name has been  changed  N times , 

  the collision probability is one halfs if we have tried 2^64 different versions, based on the birthday paradox.

  as long as we haven't changed the name more than 2^(32) times , we are extremely unlikely to find a collision.

  and , because of the practical nature , we obviously do not have 4 gigabytes of functions/types/... *with the same name mangle* ( other than the hash) in the same binary,

  it is simply too much names  to be a practical limitation .

  


 

 the hashs dependent on their dependancies form a tree ( no cycles ) and any changes in any part of the tree will alter all above sections of the tree , similar to a murcle tree , so any changes in the ABI of a section will force all dependent sections to need a new link target .

 

 

 

---



runtime libraries and compilation



the objective of a full ABI is to allow arbitrary mixing of object files produced by conforming implementations, by fully specifying the binary interface of application programs.



- there are 8 main steps( might ):

 1. determine the dependency graph of the mcc files, irs and modules ( to help realize parallelization opertonities, and determine if some steps are not neccecery if the result is cached and valid).

 2. compile to the AST object/modules.

 3. compile the asts to mcc ir-0 .

 4. for every `constexpr` ir-0 path , evaluate all `constexpr` code and generate mcc ir-1 files.

 5. for every ir-1 file , optimize the code to ir-2 files.

 6.  using all of the summary and dependency graph information,  we make an ir-3 file for each partially-independent unit of execution in the graph to be optimized , we do the processing of these files then we, link all ir-3 files in the mcc linker to an ir-4 file, this is  ThinLTO style .

 7. map ir-4 the code to the target assembly, while optimizing unnececery register usage , for example by register allocation optimizations and generate an object file( also happens with the previous step).

 8. link the object files to an executable.







--- 

the mcc toolchain and ABI outside of c colon:



 with the absolute expressive power of the c colon IR and ABI ,  there might be languages or toochsins who soly focus on a language with c colon like ABI ,

 for example :

 

  1. the mcc-CPP transpiler: 

      a rust compiler that compiles c++ into mcc-ir.

  2. mcc-rust:

      a rust compiler that compiles rust into mcc-ir.

  3.  functional colon :
     a functional language that compiles into c colon  or mcc-ir which most functions are implicitly purely functional in thr c colon code.

  4.   express colon :
  a simple  language , a subset of c colon ,where only safe c colon code is valid ,most  qualifiers are invisible-implicit and inaccessibile.
  this is a more begginners friendly language that has the same ABI and type system as c colon , but without many of its complexities, so the unsafe parts can be written in libraries in c colon.    

      

---

express colon  or "E:":



a language  for those who like simplicity while writing c colon.



this language aims to be in the simple systems languages category.







this languages goals include:



the first and foremost goal is simplicity,  in contrast to c colon.

the second goal is being exceptionally safe ( pun intended).

the third goal is being blazingly fast ( lower priority than simplicity though).

 i categorize them , and show what is needed to achieve these :





1. deep integration with c colon:



 the language is an abstraction built on top of c colon,

 the c colon standard and libraries often focus on low level design while express colon is more friendly for newcomers. 

 

 

 2. simplicity:

 

  most complex code are implicit ,

  for example instead of references , developers use in/`inout`/out and values , 

  this makes this code readable and object oriented while being very safe and optimizable.

  containers are represented by value oriented objects and no poiner or reference semantics is required. 

  it  might not be as fast as c: , it may use more dynamic types or copies,  but for application logic its far more elegant,

  and if it wasnt optimal , you can always go a level down to c colon land to optimize it.

 

3.  safety :



     the reason for safety being granteed for express colon, ( if the c colon libraries  used internally are well written and safe ) is that there is no referencing to begin with,  imagine using a member from a vector,  you aren't using a reference to it , so you must copy it ,so you will never worry if the vector reallocation will invalidate anything,  because you do not have any reference to begin with. 

     you dont need to borrow anything because you only need to change its value,  most functions can use either full value semantics or fall into using a reference-counted variable if they truly need multiple ownership.

    any unsafe code is delt with in the internal c colon libraries,  freeing the burden of safety concers from the developers.

    references being disallowed means that express colon by definition cannot use after free, cannot use invalid state,  cannot even intract with dead state, 

    because the only thing allowed to be modified is the value of objects,

    even data races cannot be made in express colon because the reference counted variable provided by c colon is either a totally immutable value or protected via a read write lock ( assuming the c colon libraries dont provide safe looking unsafe abstractions)

    although  dead locks can be a concern in highly parallel environments,  they don't really cause memory unsafty.

    even stack overflows can be tracked  if context objects use the reflection information into a stack trace ( for example by having a counter incremented by the stack usage of a frame when the context begins and having a maximum threshold before a contract violation occurs).

    contracts like pre post and assertions can be checked through any means of function call , so the safety of a function is always  preserved. 

    while,like rust , its still possible to make a self referential  reference counter `std::rc_t`/`std::arc_t` who will be "leaked", this is not a common issue and not a memory unsafty,  it still can be resolved with `std::weak_rc_t` or `std::weak_arc_t` ( proving this will not happen  by the compiler is very hard , and resolution of this issue requires a garbage collector and graph traversal,  which is not what we want, but a memory leak is still not a security exploit but a programmer bug , similar to a deadlock)

    also,  if you noticed that you need an `abi=` in a structure, because the hash of the internal reference needs the hash of the external loop , congratulations, you've found the part that needs a weak reference, this is because the hash dependency chain created via a dependency  of T to its arc<T> and arc<T> to T is exactly the thing that makes arc<T> a candidate for a self referential reference. 

    or your just trying to implement a tree , graph or linked list , which you can do via reference counted variables , but your notified of its potential for a self reference when you used `abi=` to make it compile again. 

    however,  an extreme measure against all cycles is  making the use of `abi=` as unsafe(abi=) , this makes any E colon code unable to make any liked list , graph or tree like structure and etc , and severly limits many forms of inheritance,  but it grantees that all reference counters will be freed .

    ( this is the default therefore  any use of `abi=` is unsafe and so E colon programs cannot have memory leaks by default,  unless the feature flag is altered,  the reason fot this is , lets assume T has a storage mechanism to a tree , this tree either doesn't have T ( which means no cycles to T) or it does , if it does , T's ABI hash would become dependent  on the graph that is itself dependent on T , and because we cannot type erase T to not depend on itself , and  we cannot cause a brake in the ABI chain via `abi=` , then we really cant form a cycle ( assuming c colon libraries dont provide any type erasure primitives , but only sum types ( like rust `enum` or CPP std variant) ) ( because  the virtual table ABI is dependent on the type of the  class argument,and the class  is dependent on the virtual table), ( and std::any like types are not provided to E colon because its too low level for it) 

    arguably this is extreme , and we cant always grantee that no open-set type erasure will be provided from c colon,   but i would say that if E colon developers want to make a self referential type, it would be more elegant in C colon , and probably there are graph, linked list  and tree libraries that can do that.

    and ,abi= is already low level enough to be a c colon only spec,

    for this reason,  all forms of non trivial type erasure ( erasure of a type with non trivial destructor) is unsafe ,

    for example , E colon can only do bitcast if and only if the type of source and dest are trivially relocatable and trivially destructable and have no pointer/references in their layouts ( to prevent memory leak via type erasure), but in C colon , we can do unsafe(bit-cast) to do any form of bit cast( or other casts) . also , beacuse making a thread is unsafe(threads) , the async scheduler is in c colon and E colon remains free of its compications.

    

4. speed :



 even in-value oriented code,  functions can throw errors with ease and speed , the values often flow in registers and they are optimized well beacuse of lack of aliases .

 happy path often has less branches compared to using optional/expected/result types, and sad path is more performant than cxx-throw or rust panic, and as performant as optional types.

 the variable access is often faster , because in architectures like x86 , almost 1 kilobytes can be passed between functions via prameters in registers with ease.

 

5. rich set of libraries:



the standard library aims to have many of the widely used utilities,  for example networking libraries,  asynchronous frameworks and web like UI development utilities. 

this is because the standard can change the ABI of these components at later versions so it doesn't need to worry about backwards compatibility. 



6. easy to use package management with ABI stability:



users don't need to worry about using old or vulnerable code , or complex building process. 



7. safe with rare  borrowing errors:



 the E colon domain of the code aims to be  type-safe,memory-safe , exception-safe and violation-safe uncless specified otherwise via dropping into c colon unsafe.



theres no traditional borrowing in express colon , because references aren't allowed,  only value oriented reference-like alternatives are, this is because most simple objectives can be achieved soly via containers, dynamic referencing containers and value types,

the express colon language also tends to look more functional than its c colon counterparts,  many changes to heap variables happening in monadic like fashion if they are garded via a mutex, or value based of they are easily movable and copyable, while the underlying c colon has borrowing rules,  express colon programs still dont need lifetime anotations ( the c colon libraries however probably do)



8. fast enough application logic:

 

 the function argument flow specifiers ( like a reference  but without stable address on trivial reallocation) the in (akin to const & )  , out (akin to mutable uninitialized& ) and `inout` (akin to mutable& ) prameters are all trivial reallocation and register passed, 

 however because of the ABI nature they will remain valid for the duration of the function call so they are inheritly safe. 

 the in-val ( no specifier) does a copy or a drop/relocation  on most occasions .

 these are ideal for register usage ,  but they introduce more copying and occasionally the need for reference counting if dynamic  referencing is necessary, 

although this is fast enough so its good enough,  if not , c colon can be used to optimize  it more.







  

  9.  elegant parallel programming with safety and structured concurrency:

  

  for example,  common  monadic operations can be made in a lambda function that is hidden inside of a for loop, this doesn't look like were using a monadic operation here , but we implicitly are doing that, while still benefiting from readability of c style for loops, iteration-primitive can be a mutex,  can be a vector,  can be an optional, 

  the option for monadic lambdas is provided,  but common  monands can be expressed with ease.

 ( note that iteration-primitive is written in c colon as it involves more complex machinery)

 ``` 

  for ( `inout` variable: iteration-primitive) {// function body beginning, the function captues the sate and has an `inout` argument 

// modify variable.

}// lambda scope end



for ( auto [`inout` a, in b, out c, d ]: iteration-primitive){// function body beginning, the function captues the state and has an multiple argument provided in the iterator internals.

// d is copied , a , b and c are "referenced" via value input outputs

// modify outputs.

// loop control flow is dictated with iterator context and the context-type 

// it not a coroutine so it has:

// makes the iteration primitive call operator break(...) context-type ->lambda-return

break;

// makes the iteration primitive call operator continue(...) context-type  ->lambda-return

continue;

// makes the iteration primitives call operator return (...) context-type -> lambda-return

return...;

// theres an implicit continue at the end of scope   

}// lambda scope end , once the function ends via the iteration-primitive, it can either implicitly return a value or continue execution or throw.





// the context object  acts like the promise type in c++, providing much needed abstractions , providing many low level primitives in c colon , however , most coroutine usage is restricted in express colon to safe usage of libraries.

10. multi paradigm:



 while  more restricted values would result OOP virtual inheritance  being more heap and mutext based use because of the referenced ban ( or completely disallowed because of the `abi=` ban) .

 however rust-like `enum` types with pattern matching  are still very performant and value oriented .

 and object oriented ( without inheritance) would still be whidly used ,

 for example constructors would output the self object to  out prameters,

 copy would use the in parameter and moving/ relocation would be automatically generated(  not using any references would make types trivial to automatically relocate if inner c colon types are trivial) . 

 the destructor would also use in-val ( no specifier) to relocate the object for final destruction. 

  these aren't just safe , these are also fast , because trivial values are passed by registers , and this language mostly operates on trivial values 



11. easy errors:



i pridict that the worst common error is an easy "must initialized an out prameter" or "make a copy of a variable and use that instead of passing itself to multiple function prameters"( the reason being that variables are relocated to the prameter when the prameter is created and will be relocated back when the prameter is "destroyed"  in c colon land , but , often the only use after-rellocation-error is these , which can be avoided  by declaration of a new variable  ), which is , simple and far better than lifetimes or memory bugs.

or at most a " the catch block cannot caputure a variable that might be dropped in the try block , try copying that variable before the try block to ensure it will not be an output of a throwing function"( the `inout` or out function  arguments  will  have an uninitialized state or qualifier  on that functios throw path in the caller, when used , the same qualifier set per expression rule will make that expression ill formed).

in contrast to C colon ( which allows all of these c++ style things) , Express colon does not have operator overloadding,and also function overloadding,  and template specializations, and only allows simple template declarations ( like the c++ auto concept constraint prameters),

this isn't really a safety problem,  but an error massage problem,  

if express colon wants readable error massages in its express colon module,  it needs to have less type anotations necessary to show that error message,  and therefore,  much type information would not be shown because the function name and at most the namespace would be sufficient for its detection. 

most template specifications can just be ignored by default in express colon,  however C colon errors may not have much clarity without those informations. 

however E colon still recognizes these C colon constructs , allowing custom types like `std::(u)intdyn_t` ( similar to python's big integer types) to be used by their overloaded operators.

 similarly, common pitfalls like cyclic object hash dependency chains have relatively good information on their errors " it seems that your building a graph like structure within your types , however types dependent on themselves tend to be error prone , firstly,  use `abi=` operators to resolve the cyclic hash , secondly,  if dynamic referencing is involved,  consider using weak pointers as well, because it would help avoid leaks".

 

12. exception safety:



 because of the implicit one qualifier set per expression rule, any E: function that might modify its arguments on the throw statement,  the arguments would not be usable after that throw, 

 that's why all the value oriented catch blocks would not encounter unexpected states (those who were in the process of completion but couldn't because of an exception).

 although this means that often containers who have a single incomplete value would also get dropped or put in an empty state ,

 for example  what happens if an exception happens in a reference counted mutex modification lambda , that mutex would need to be put in an error state , this way , any later code that attempts to access that mutex would throw an incomplete mutex error.

 in my opinion,  this is a good thing,  even rust panics dont have such properties,  because if a value is modified through a reference then it throws and attems to catch a panic ,  the previous value is gone! , it is memory safe to access it yes , but it might be incomplete so its s logic error.

 also , in my view, it is bad to assume panic safety is something obscure, 

 any function and its contracts might fail and need to propegate errors ,

 even if the error is a bug , in a critical system it is not really good to just crash the program or put it in a bad state.

  i think that terminations is very brutal , because of this exception handling mechanism , i think all violations are represented by an exception, 

  this is fast and effective , violations *can* be terminations,  and violation catching is unsafe , but generally program will be fine and exception would be lead to a  terminate in main with very sane stack trace and debug info ( if we choose).

roadmap:



1. build a C colon subset language front-end for llvm in c++:

this in itself will require substantial work .



2. build one or more  standards documents with clear information,  similar to the cxx spec, and the cxx ABI specs:

this would need to be designed carefully and diligently to ensure that the language stays well-defined.



3. ( dependent on 1 and 2) migrate the C colon front-end to a  C colon codebase:

not in scope rn.



4. ( dependent on 3) replacement or extension ( probably a fork ) of the llvm back-end, linker:

not in scope rn, but the reason being is to be able to nativity support the mcc ABI in all platforms instead of piggybacking it on top of the c ABI .



5. ( dependent on 4) rewriting the full toolchain in c colon:

not in scope rn





- considerations: 

yes , this is too ambitious to build in few years,let alone quickly,  however if we let ourselves to build the 2 first parts by not focusing on performance ( because the ABI is build on top of llvm ir with its conventions around calls ), we may be able to get the language up and running to build itself eventually in the following years to come.

 improvments and advancements compared to cxx ( in the performance category):
  0. so maybe one day CPP can be as fast:

  i always have loved C++ , even seeing it now with all its legecy , cxx still can be like c colon , heck i wanted c colon to be a c++ superset , but i dont think i can change anything major in it anytime soon, in hopes that a std c++xx maybe powered by mcc  can be as fast as c colon  in the following decades
  
 1. ABI brakage leads to better implementations:
 the 128 bit recursive hash ABI makes this possible.

 2. minimal and fast stack spill :

 when all the registers modifted are known , we can just put values in those that are not modified,

 when presssure is too high , all the registers are stored(call)/loaded(return) at once (or even have entier hot code sections that do this via a ```move ret ip; jump __mccabiv1::pop_all or jump __mccabiv1::push_all```), on architechures like x86 , cpus can parrarelize multiple stores or multiple loads but not intertwined load and stores like those in cxx calls.

 also the fastdyncaller qualifier really helps reduce the register usage.

 all the arguments and their data flow in registers also helps significantly.
 also , i doubt that even asm experts can track register allocation across all programs , its too much mental overhead for humans.
 


 3. dynamic cast:

   bigger v-table sizes but much faster cast with less cache miss.
   smaller object size because of the v-table pointer only being in the refrence type.



 4. fast exception paths, fast happy path,fast `enum` types :

 all with the split return channel, no if on the happy path , no cxx lib unwind on the sad path , just caller code, i envision compilers even collapsing offsets to particular values to avoid table duplication.

 

 5. rich aliasing info , and function purity metrics:

 for example stable values dont need to be loaded two times in registers to be captured! , they can be loaded only one time


6. layout optimizations :
  on top of rust like memory reorder , c colon has non `not_offset_dependant` qualifiers,  meaning that if a sub-object is referenced in memory , the entire object does not need to be placed in memory,  but only that sub-object,  especially true for trivially relocatable types ,
  for example  if i have an array of offset independent members,  and reference a member,  i can just only use the memory of that member and other members may not be in ajason stack memory , also it might help in making array of structures to structure of array
  on the stack ,  reflection also can help with this
  
 7. allocation Ellison :
 its similar to how cxx does coroutine frame Ellison.

 8.  less interposition depending dynamic dispatch  :
   when code is similar and linked together, it can be sometimes de duplicated,
also if a function's address is not taken or exported it doesn't need a fixed address, also the relaxed function addresss help in dew duplicated code.
also static data like strings would be able to merge better with  valexpr ( because  no null termination,  sub string merge is safe)

9.  fast program and dll loader:
all mcc symbols have two kinds of name mangles , the front-end mangle and the back-end mangle ,
the front-end one is like cxx but with the ABI hash appended , the back-end mangle is a 256bit hash of the front-end mangle ,
this is to make all symbols have a fixed size and to be able to store all symbols needing work on startup or dll load in an  array of sorted hashes ( 32 arrayes of bytes beacuse of 256 bit nature) ( similar layout to what mcc dynamic cast `castation-tables` had)
, ( because of the hashed  nature we can use the fast radix sort to make this array in backend in the linker) this helps along side the interposition less code , to help reduce start up times.
when loading a dll , those sorted arrays of hashes combine into one array , similar to the merge (O(n)) in merge sort ,
while doing so , we can spot all duplicate symbols if any and do the appropriate thing accordingly 

10. more parrarelized code  and structured concurrency:
by enabling cancelation in the ABI of coroutines we can swiftly do many structural concurrency patterns, 
std primitives such as tasks , channels,schedulers,  promises etc help here .
